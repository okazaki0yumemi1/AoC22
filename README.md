Solving Advent of Code 2022 puzzles

Hello! 
This is my take on solving Advent of Code 2022 (https://adventofcode.com/2022) puzzles.
They aren't as hard to crack as Codewars ones, but it's still a challenge for me.

The project consists of Program.cs file, Task#, where # is the number of puzzle in Advent of Code 2022 website. The input for all these puzzles comes from Task#_Data.txt in "Text Files" directory. You can modify it, just keep in mind that I've yet to implement input filtering.
